I am writing to you to raise concerns about perceived instances of retaliation by Manager.
Over the past 1 week, have experienced behavior from manaager that we believe constitutes retaliation for speaking up about workplace issues and concerns.

There have been instances where i have raised valid concerns have faced negative repercussions, including reassignment of duties and verbal intimidation. 
These actions have not only affected me personally but have also created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation among colleagues


I have attached documentation of these incidents, including emails and meeting notes, for your review.

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into these allegations and take appropriate action to address the situation. 
I committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive workplace culture, and it is imperative that management leads by example in upholding these values.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or clarification.
